I am a first year PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.illinois.edu/) departement and the [Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL)](https://csl.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is [Dr. Seyed Rasoul Etesami](https://etesami.ise.illinois.edu/). 

I am interested in game theory and reinforcement learning. In particular, I am passionate about problems involving decesion-making under uncertainty, especillay in multi-agent environments. I like studying agents' behaviors in presence of other agents, especially when their interests are not aligned. I am also interested in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.ee.sharif.ir/en/), Iran. I then completed my master's degree in ECE at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/), under supervision of [Dr. Seyed Majid Zahedi](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~smzahedi/). During my master's, I developed a fictitious mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm that works efficiently for load balancing problem in distributed systems. My thesis can be found [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/712ba706-387e-4319-92ea-e2e812cd8e9d).

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at [Microchip Technology](https://www.microchip.com/) in Toronto, Canada.
